<p>Last weekend I decided to try baking bread at home for the very first time. I followed a simple recipe and learned a few things along the way — some mistakes and some happy surprises!</p>


<h2>Ingredients I Used</h2>
<p>Flour, water, yeast, salt, and a little patience. That’s all you need to begin.</p>


<h3>Step-by-step (short)</h3>
<p>Mix the ingredients, knead the dough, let it rise, shape it, and then bake. Rest, then enjoy.</p>


<blockquote>
"Baking is both a science and an art — the oven is your lab and your canvas." — Unknown
</blockquote>


<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>The dough needs a warm place to rise. Be gentle while shaping. And always, always preheat the oven.</p>
